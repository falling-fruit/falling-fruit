      unverified_help: Locations are marked as unverified if their position, identity,
        or existence is disputed. Many locations imported from tree inventories are
        marked as unverified because their edibility is uncertain (for example, "Pear"
        could be either an edible or decorative variety). Users are encouraged to
        travel to these locations and report their findings.

      freegan_modal_html: In addition to our efforts mapping the <a href="/?locale=en">edible
        plants</a> growing in cities, we've set out to map the world's food-bearing
        dumpsters. Nearly half of all food produced in the developed world is never
        eaten. We're hoping to raise awareness around food waste, facilitate the liberation
        of discarded food, and encourage businesses to <a href="/sharing?locale=en">donate
        their food</a> instead.<br/><br/>In support of a lower-waste lifestyle, we
        are encouraging the mapping of all freegan sources (from dumpsters to free
        boxes) with discarded but useful goods, edible or otherwise.
      freegan_modal_title: Welcome to our freegan map!
      grafter_modal_html: Guerrilla Grafters graft fruit-bearing branches onto ornamental,
        non-fruiting fruit tree varieties (for example, cities often use sterile fruit
        trees for their colorful spring blossoms). Over time, delicious, nutritious
        fruit is made available to neighborhoods thanks to these grafts. You can learn
        more about the project at <a href="http://guerrillagrafters.org">guerrillagrafters.org</a><br/><br/>This
        map shows some of the most common ornamental fruit trees. If you are a grafter,
        a gardener, or a fruit tree enthusiast, contribute to the information commons
        and tag the trees in your yard or neighborhood that can be grafted with fruit-bearing
        branches!

        Hello! It looks like you're accessing Falling Fruit from a <strong>mobile device</strong>. We recently released a crowdfunded mobile app for both Android and iOS mobile platforms. I think you'll find it's much more pleasant to use on your mobile device:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/falling-fruit/id380859409">Falling Fruit for iOS</a>

        </ul>
        <br>
        100% of proceeds from app sales go to support our hard costs (servers and infrastructure to keep the site online). We're a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, so this cost is also tax-deductible in the US.

      ana_carolina_bio_html: Ana is a postdoctoral researcher at the Federal University
        of Pará in Brazil. She is an anthropologist interested in understanding social
        and cultural diet habits. Ana worked mostly in the Brazilian Amazon. In Acre
        (western Amazon) she studied regional fruit consumption. Then, she worked
        in the Middle Solimões region, investigating diet change in remote communities.
        Between 2017 and 2018, Ana lived in small and medium towns of the Amazon Delta,
        looking at the effects of climate change on the food security of people living
        in informal settlements. She recently moved to southern New Mexico in the
        United States, where she works as a consultant.
      caleb_phillips_bio_html: Caleb is a featherless bipedal humanoid passionate
        about food justice and finding creative ways to use technology to address
        social issues. When he's not biking around gawking at trees, he balances his
        efforts between his day job as a data scientist at the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/research/caleb-phillips.html">National
        Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> in Golden, Colorado and as an adjunct professor
        of computer science at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/caleb-phillips">University
        of Colorado</a>. Besides all that work stuff, he likes to climb rocks, run
        trails, ride bikes, and generally be outdoors as much as possible. Caleb created
        Falling Fruit with Ethan Welty in 2013 and served on the Board of Directors
        for 6 years before taking a position on the Advisory Board.
      celebration: Falling Fruit is a celebration of the overlooked culinary bounty
        of our city streets. By quantifying this resource on an interactive map, we
        hope to facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural
        organisms growing in our neighborhoods. Not just a free lunch! Foraging in
        the 21st century is an opportunity for urban exploration, to fight the scourge
        of stained sidewalks, and to reconnect with the botanical origins of food.

      closing_remarks_para2_html: Harvesting food in an urban setting comes with certain
        practical and moral considerations. For an introduction to the ethics of urban
        foraging, we recommend the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SupIGQKC5Vgi3VYkdIQc05y_S7jSoZ4RTS-CzwlEAMY">summary</a>.
      closing_remarks_para3_html: Information on Falling Fruit may be wrong or out
        of date. For example, many of the foraging maps migrated to Falling Fruit
        were hosted as public Google Maps on which markers were often moved accidentally,
        and municipal tree inventories are updated only (if ever) as trees are visited
        for maintenance. Be prepared to encounter inaccuracies in the field, and please
        edit the map as needed based on your discoveries. Ultimately, it is your responsibility
        to determine the identity, edibility, and location of a plant, and the responsibility
        of all to improve the quality of the map.

        be the best tool available to the contemporary forager. Write us at <a href="mailto:feedback@fallingfruit.org">feedback@fallingfruit.org</a>,

        forager, and proud mother to two cats, four quails, and the world's most magnificent
        canine. Her roots stretch deep into the Rocky Mountains, but these days her

      jeff_wanner_bio_html: Since harvesting black and blueberries with his family
        as a child and, more recently, noticing the wealth of public fruit trees throughout
        Colorado, Jeff has developed a deep appreciation for the abundance of fruit
        growing in our cities. His first mission for Falling Fruit was to comb Boulder
        and Salt Lake City, paper maps in-hand, to record fruiting trees. When not
        working to improve building energy efficiency, he is usually helping out in
        the community or moving quickly over mountains by foot, ski, or bicycle.

        and sharing with neighbors and the needy.
      more_about_html: Our edible map is not the first of its kind, but it aspires
        to be the world's most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations
        of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to
        unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. The <a
        href="/datasets?locale=en">imported datasets</a> range from small neighborhood
        foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. This so far
        amounts to %{types} different types of edibles (most, but not all, plant species)
        distributed over %{locations} locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace
        to the exotic flavors of foreign plants and long-forgotten native plants,
        foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.

      tristram_stuart_bio_html: 'As a teenager, Tristram raised pigs on surplus food
        that he collected from his school kitchens, the local baker and village greengrocer.
        Noticing that a lot of this food was still suitable for human consumption
        led him to the realization that good, fresh food was being wasted on a colossal
        scale. Tristram has since worked tirelessly to bring this issue to the attention
        of the public, the media, and policy-makers. He founded the food waste campaign
        organization <a href="//feedbackglobal.org">Feedback Global</a> and wrote
        <a href="//tristramstuart.co.uk/">Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal</a>
        to demonstrate the extent of the problem on a global scale. In 2011, Tristram
        was awarded <a href="//www.sofieprisen.no/Prize_Winners/2011/index.html">The
        Sophie Prize</a> for his fight against food waste.'

      intro: Falling Fruit is built on public data and the generosity of our users.
        We want urban foraging to reach as many people as possible, and we believe
        that everyone should have equal access to the fruits of our collective labor.

        dataset of urban edibles. While our users explore, edit, and add locations
        using our <a href="/?locale=en">map</a>, we comb the known universe for pre-existing
        datasets and import them directly into the <a href="/data?locale=en">database</a>,

      types_of_data: Datasets imported into Falling Fruit fall into two main categories.
        "Community maps" are built by foragers and freegans as they peruse their communities
        for things to eat. We are indebted to the hardworking citizen-cartographers
        who have compiled this data. "Tree inventories" are compiled by cities, universities,
        and other institutions wishing to better document and care for their trees.
        We mine these vast datasets for food-producing species and add them to the
        map. To help us map your neighborhood fruit trees, contact your school or
        city urging them to share their tree inventory with us.
